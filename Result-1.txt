		The file getting processed and the converted postfix notations are  abc*+ and Invalid Expression 
		One more statement to test your coding skills to handle the character arrya without using any builtin funciton, 
		so show this expression in to prefix form InvalidxEpression  
		The skill test doesn't stop there,
		you have to evaluate on more statement to prove your  skills on basic stack working. 
		Evalaution result of provided strings are a+b*c 
		
	 
		So,you said you enjoyed the previous assignment and learned much and more :). Now, tell me the about the number of galxies in the picture.		
		Total galxies in picture are  3  
		
	
		this is just check your stack handling skills.   so i hope you will pass   this test also 
		so keep going   So, now I am tried of this thing. I think that's enough.

		Process this file Convert the given Infix expressions to postfix expression using standard algorithm.  ABCDEFGH/*-+ 
                  and xy^5z*/2+ and InvalidxEpression .

                Show your Coding skills and Dont use any built-in function for handling character array
		Read the below algorithm
 	        Steps to Convert Postfix to Infix :
		Read the symbol from the input .based on the input symbol go to step 2 or 3.
		If symbol is operand then push it into stack.
		If symbol is operator then pop top 2 values from the stack.
		this 2 popped value is our operand .
		create a new string and put the operator between this operand in string.
		push this string into stack.
		At the end only one value remain in stack which is our infix expression.

		Input the the expression to convert it into Infix form abc*+ and abcde*/-+  
		
		Wait you have to do one more task to complete this assignment
		you have to evaluate on more statement to prove your  skills on basic stack working. 
		Show the result if the given string after evaluation Invalid Expression 
		
	 
		Did you miss assignment 1?. Now, tell me the about the number of galxies in the picture. ):		
		Total galxies in picture are  2  Don't forget to save the genrated images in output folder.
		
	 
		
		This is simply a test of your stack management abilities.  So, I hope you pass this test as well,  so keep going.  
		So now  'm sick of this stuff That, I believe, is sufficient.

		Do you remember the questions in our school exams where we evaluated an infix, postfix or prefix expression?
		The only thing we could wish for then is a computer program that would directly give us the answer on entering the expression as input. 
		Well, guess what?
		A common question in the coding rounds of interviews is to write a program for “Expression evaluation using Stack”. 
		In this article, we will learn how to solve that question.
                The file getting processed and the converted Infix notations are  AB+CD/*E- and InvalidxEpression and mn*pq-r++ .
		One more statement to test your coding skills to handle the character arrya without using any builtin funciton, 
		so show this expression in to Infix form ABCDE*/-+ and mnpq*r++-  
		
                  To begin with, let us see how infix expression evaluation using stack.  16 
		
	 
		So,you said you enjoyed the previous assignment and learned much and more :). Now, tell me the about the number of galxies in the picture.		
		Total galxies in picture are  2
